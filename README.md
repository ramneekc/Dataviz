# StarterBook Report
```Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?```  
1.	We can tell the number of campaigns that were successful, failed or canceled.  
2.	We can find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.  
3.	We can find the percentage funded and average donation made by each campaign.  

```What are some limitations of this dataset?```  
Even though you can find the number of projects that were failed or canceled but the dataset doesnâ€™t provide the information on why those projects were canceled or failed.

```What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?```  
1.	We can create a table showing the successful projects above a certain percentage funded.  
2.	We can find which category received the most funds based on average donation.
