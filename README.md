# Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.
# Task
Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover some market trends.

# Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.

# Pivot table to count of how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.

# Created a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

# Conclusion
```Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?```  
1.	We can tell the number of campaigns that were successful, failed or canceled.  
2.	We can find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.  
3.	We can find the percentage funded and average donation made by each campaign.  

```What are some limitations of this dataset?```  
Even though you can find the number of projects that were failed or canceled but the dataset doesnâ€™t provide the information on why those projects were canceled or failed.

```What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?```  
1.	We can create a table showing the successful projects above a certain percentage funded.  
2.	We can find which category received the most funds based on average donation.
